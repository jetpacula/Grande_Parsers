my rocket titties made their debut here
i use them all the time
personally but they publicly made their
debut in this video as well
they're very useful though
hi laura it's ariana grande
and today i'm going to be breaking down
some of my most
iconic videos
by the way they told me to use the word
iconic i didn't assume that
so this video was directed by the young
astronauts by my friend nev
and she and i collaborated on this
concept i
really love the 60s i've always loved
that era for glamour for
wardrobe for
aesthetic film choreography everything
the dancing scene in this video was
actually inspired by
sweet charity and the wardrobe it's
pretty
almost identical but yeah i really
i love that era so we had a lot of fun
dipping a toe in here and then i never
kind of dipped any toes out for the rest
of my life also i love iggy's glam here
i loved her makeup i loved her hair it
was funny because my ponytail in this
scene
was actually not
that high or teased
and
like five minutes before we rolled i was
like this looks too
uh and then i just went in the mirror
and i just grabbed and i was like like
went like this and i brought it up
really high and i sort of okay we don't
need a bunch of memes with me going like
this anywhere but it's okay it's too
late so it
um
this is one of my favorite videos this
one is break free
directed by chris mars i had the time of
my life
shooting this video i
loved this makeup chris buckle did this
makeup put a bunch of stickers from
michael's or something on my face and
they definitely weren't supposed to be
there i think delena did this hair
and johnny woojack did this wardrobe it
was a beautiful
fun video i've always loved
vintage interpretations of space and
like what the future looks like but in
the 50s or 60s i always thought that was
so cool big barbarella fan
obviously i continue to channel her as
much as possible there's a really cool
deleted scene on the internet somewhere
where we recreated the who shot first
scene from star wars which was really
fun as well my rocket titties made their
debut here
i use them all the time
personally but they publicly made their
debut in this video as well
they're very useful though
love me harder 2014 featuring the
weekend this was our first time
collaborating it was really fun
this concept
didn't feel very personal to me as i'm
sitting in a old chair and some sand and
i end up in water for some reason i'm
dressed as some sort of kitten
i
i love the look in it i love the look i
kind of gave up the reins here and was
just kind of like go for it
and then i really i really fought hannah
for the kitty ears i'm really glad that
i did though cause i really like them
i think it would have felt almost too
serious without the ears for me
so this is side to side featuring nicki
minaj 2016. we were going back and forth
and back and forth about
what should this concept be and i
remember i was on the treadmill
thinking and listening to
my playlist of what was becoming the
dangerous woman album and i
got to side to side and i was like why
does this feel so fun to listen to on
the treadmill and i facetimed hannah and
i said we should be on soulcycle bikes
and she was like oh i'll call you back
and then pull together all these dope
visual references she's like you and
nikki have to be in the sauna i don't
love the look
the with the leggings and the
stringy bra thing but i love the other
ones i love the one on the bike the one
in the leggings feels like i was forced
into it it probably was
one is no tears left to cry
2018 directed by dave myers
this was a really fun video simply
because of how much preparation went
into it the rotating
set
that we had to build to create the first
scene
took so long to get used to and we
rehearsed the day before and it was so
much fun i
pitched dave this idea of sort of
multiple fields of gravity because
of a game i was playing at the time
called monument valley on my phone i
told him how much i loved escher stairs
and stuff like that and we sort of
mushed everything together and created
the sweetener what really was sort of
like the centerpiece for the sweetener
album and era which was
this sort of play on being upside down
and
not knowing what is right and what is up
because also personally in my life at
the time i was sort of upside down and
not knowing where the ground was and not
feeling very grounded or
okay
so
yeah i felt like that was a really nice
cool way to visually represent what i
was feeling
during those moments really
the fashion here
is really fun i loved the polka dot
umbrella dress
i really loved that i remember feeling
so joyful in that this was styled by la
roche and
i loved these
looks i think they're so much fun
god is a woman 2018 also directed by
dave myers this was
such a fun video to do
this was glam by ash and josh
and
styled by mimi catrell this one was so
much fun because obviously there are so
many
beautiful ways to express
femininity and
what it is to be a woman and there's so
many things to lean into
as far as
paying homage to art that already exists
and also creating our own so yeah we had
a lot of fun with this one of my
favorite moments is probably when i'm
fingering the earth
loved that a lot i also loved
recreating the moment the michelangelo
moment at the end because
i
was able to tease that we were putting
that in this video at the met gala when
i worked with vera wang on my dress i
liked that connection to me that was
that felt exciting and i felt giddy
knowing and then i loved that sort of
water color
that i'm swimming in in the beginning i
think it's so beautiful alexa mead did
that art on my sort of face and hair and
boobs and
in the water as well that is not
random paint it's not a pool that's
for sure
this is thank you next from 2018. i
loved this video so much the funny thing
about this
is that
we were
working on the breathing video hannah
and i were in new york
filming the video for breathing
breathing kind of was like the tail end
single of
sweetener because it kind of
life
thrust me into the thank you next album
era i didn't have any plan of moving on
that time anytime soon but i kind of had
to do that album as an artist to feel
better and i really was ready to move on
and we were
working on breathing and i was like
we have to recreate all my favorite
scenes from all my favorite movies
and make the thank you next video like
next month we have to do it and she was
like
holy sh
like nobody is more right to do this
with
than hannah she turned something
that felt
so
torrential at the time
in my life into something that
felt fun and light at least while we
were doing it and while we were making
it and
what i got to share with the world felt
you know
bright and beautiful playing regina
george was really fun playing l woods
was really fun
playing jenna rink was a dream come true
i
couldn't believe it jennifer garner even
reposted it and i love her so much i
loved being able to work with jennifer
coolidge on this she actually
recreated all of her looks from legally
blonde for this which was the biggest
honor of my entire life i worship her
i'm a humongous comedy person i
my favorite movie is best in show
and she happens to be in that as well
you should see the outtakes they're so
funny she was like i met a guy with no
teeth i made out with him it was so
weird and then i saw him under the
covers he was doing something and i was
like
trying to keep a straight face and she
was like have you ever kissed a guy with
no teeth
positions 20 20. i love this video so
much i love this glam i love this
styling
this makeup was by anthony
and my hair was by josh lu this styling
was mimi cattrell this was directed by
dave myers again
and conceptualized by my husband we were
in the car driving home and
dalton just turned to me and was like
what if you were the president and i was
like
you're perfect
i called dave this was literally three
days away from the shoot i want to say
and we just like he made it happen i
also love
the women that are in this video with me
it was really cool just to sort of
paint this picture in a feminine way and
just say you know
why couldn't it look like that why
couldn't it even look half like that
34 35
2020
directed by director x michael did this
makeup again and josh did this hair
again and this was styled by mimi again
this was another one where we took
inspiration from
that 60s sci-fi again that old horror
60s thing
is my favorite aesthetic in the world so
we tried to make it sort of
emulate that with the drippy letters and
stuff i yeah i feel so lucky to have
done this i'm choreographed by brian and
scott nicholson as well this
choreography is so silly and fun but
like also so chic i've worked with them
my whole career so
it's fun to sort of find new stories to
tell with them
and okay are we voguing today no we're
being fem bots today actually and they
are always able to
jump in and execute everything so
beautifully and
make me feel beautiful in the movements
and i appreciate them and everybody i
get to work with
thank you all so much for joining me as
i broke down some of my most i was
forced to say the word iconic earlier
but some of my most they happened music
videos thank you
i'm sorry
you have to use that you have to use
that you have to
