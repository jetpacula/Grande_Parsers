my friend and vocal coach of over 13 years, eric vetro, has started his very own podcast  its called #BackstagePassPod and i am so very proud of and excited for him. the link is on my story but its available wherever you listen to things. there are no words to describe what a gift of a human being this man is  he has been by my side every step of the way and believed in and encouraged me, my voice, my heart, my music, my ideas since i was 15. also  there is no way i would have survived what has been vocally demanded of me over the past decade without him. from simultaneously filming a television show playing a character with a squeaky, silly voice during the days and recording my debut album at night on 0 sleep, to completing 4 tours with no vocal injuries (thank you thank you god/eric), or just about anything else ive experienced in my professional (or personal) life. your guidance and friendship has been and is one of the greatest gifts in my life.  if youre a vocal, music nerd like me, this whole series will definitely be your cup of (throat coat) tea. aside from being one of the greatest teachers and healers on earth, he is just a gem of a human being, i truly cant say it enough. thank you eric for our hundreds of facetime warm ups (even when im in another country and its 3am your time) and our most cherished in person lessons where we cannot get through an exercise without laughing and our countless memories. i love youuuu 
the final #voicebattles begin tonight @nbcthevoice. thank you @kchenoweth, i love you.
its World Mental Health Day and im beyond thrilled to team up with BetterHelp again to give away up to $5 million in free therapy  i acknowledge that there are very real barriers when it comes to accessing mental health resources, and while this is only one small gesture (and amuch larger systemic problem remains) i wanted to do this again with @betterhelp in hopes of bringing access to a few more people and perhaps inspiring a few of you to try something new and prioritize your own healing. head to betterhelp.com/arianato get your free month started.

hello @nbcthevoice can september 20th hurry up please ? i love my #teamariana and i am waiting quite impatiently to be able to follow them all on instagram and to show you their work and for the world to fall in love with them the way i have 
this is your gentle reminder to please get your vaccines if you are eligible. this thing is not yet over  sharing some info because i care and if i can, id like to help anybody who is hesitant or curious with making their decision. this delta variant is very new and since data is changing all the time, ill source some links for you to stay up to speed yourself but so far... we do know that it spreads much more easily compared to previous variants. most of the spread is among unvaccinated people and in areas with low vaccination rates and yes although you can still get it while vaccinated, the vaccine helps to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death all great things to be protected against in my book. oh and if you have already gotten sick with COVID-19, you should STILL get vaccinated 
for more information especially on some of the Covid myths that are circulating the internet, go tohttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-myth-versus-fact please and reassure yourself why getting vaxxed is the move. save a life or two. who knows. some helpful accounts that i love following are: @niniandthebrain @jessicamalatyrivera @itsmadetosave

hello and screaming  cannot wait for everyone to see our first promo tomorrow for season 21 of @nbcthevoice  its ..... the most ridiculous and fun. i adore these humans so much and am already an emotional wreck worrying about saying goodbye to everyone the day of the finale and nothings even happened or aired yet. but yes  tomorrow  first promo. i love these people and this crew and my TEAM OH MY GOD and everything about this. i cant say anything else. but... simply cannot wait til we get started.
using my looper in this context brought me so much joy and felt so full circle and special to me i cant even explain  i was so excited when i brought the mmms and aaaahs back in during the verse and they were on time  had to share this one last thing
this series of Positions performances has been such a creative dream come true for me. thank you so much to @vevo and to everybody who contributed their time and energies and talent to these performances. it quite literally takes a village to create something so special so i wanted to acknowledge and say thank you so much to everybody who gave their time and brought so much life to this music. it was such a privilege and gift to me. also, thank you so much to the incredible @tydollasign and @theweeknd for joining us  its as always such an honor and pleasure.

thrilled to be working with @betterhelp to give away $1,000,000 of free therapy  
while acknowledging that therapy should not be for a privileged few but something everyone has access to, and acknowledging that this doesnt fix that issue in the long run, i really wanted to do this anyway in hopes of inspiring you to dip a toe in, to feel okay asking for help, and to hopefully rid your minds of any sort of self judgement in doing so i hope that youll take advantage of this opportunity and go to betterhelp.com/ariana to be matched with a licensed therapist for one free month. after that, youll have the choice to renew and continue. i so hope that this will be a helpful starting point and that youll be able to build space for this in your lives and continue healing is not linear or easy but you are worth the effort and time, i promise thank you so much to @betterhelp and i cant wait to do more work together. 
hbd tiny, i am taking care of you

progress was made but lets not get distracted. there is still so much to learn and do. please make sure you are registered to vote and ready for your states elections. also, note that voting from home is an option too thanks to @headcountorg  also also  today @campaignzero launched #8cantwait, a list of 8 policies to reduce police violence that can be changed immediately and save lives. please check out your city to see what can be done locally. sending love and strength. lets keep going. 
stay active, stay energized, keep sharing, keep learning  
sending strength and if you are protesting today please be safe
a lot of things feel scary, dangerous and uncertain right now... but there are things within our control: voting, contacting lawmakers, and taking the census. the most important thing you can do right now to take the power back is become a voter and know when your next election is. nine states have a primary on tuesday. the items on these ballots impact our day to day lives. were voting for more than the president. use ur voice and check out @headcountorg for resources.
again, i ask my followers to please keep signing these petitions, making donations if u are able to, continue having conversations w family and friends about racism (overt and covert) and the senseless acts of murder that happen in this country far too often, please keep reading up, following accounts on here (i will recommend some) to keep u updated and learning and sharing links and resources.. our black friends need us to show up and to be better and to be vocal. now more than ever. online. offline even more so. this is more than a post. we have to show up. there is work that needs to be done and it is absolutely on us to do it. #blacklivesmatter here are some accounts ive followed that have helped me understand more about my privilege and how to use it to help others. @privtoprog @rachel.cargle @thegreatunlearn @blklivesmatter please feel free to recommend some more as well in my comments.
ill do anything to earn my umbrella back @ladygaga pls

liz took this on facetime
thank u to everybody who supported this song, this cause and made this happen. we love uuuuu so much.  theres so much to celebrate today.  however, i would like to say a few things. anyone who knows me or has followed me for a while knows that numbers arent the driving force in anything i do. im grateful to sing. grateful to have people who want to listen. grateful to even be here at all. i didnt have a number one for the first five years of my career and it didnt upset me at all because from the bottom of my heart, music is everything to me. my fans are everything to me. i promise i couldnt ask for another fucking thing. so with this celebration today, i would like to address a few things which i dont usually do (i dont give my energy to drama or strange accusations normally but this has gone a little too far)...my fans bought the song. JUSTINS fans bought the song. OUR fans bought this song (never more than four copies each, AS THE RULES STATE). they are ride or die motherfuckers and i thank god every day that i have them in my life. not just when they fight for us to win (even when i ask them not to as i did this week) but because theyre some of the greatest people i know. sales count for more than streams. u can not discredit this as hard as u try. to anybody that is displeased with their placement on the chart this week or who is spending their time racking their brain thinking of as many ways as they can to discredit hardworking women (and only the women for some reason.....), i ask u to take a moment to humble yourself. be grateful youre even here. that people want to listen to u at all. its a blessed position to be in. ive had a lot of almost number ones in my career and i never said a goddamn thing because I FEEL GRATEFUL TO EVEN BE HERE. TO WANT TO BE HEARD AT ALL .... and you should feel that way too. congratulations to all my talented ass peers in the top ten this week. even number 3.  and thank u to @billboard for this honor. and thank u to everybody who helped us raise a lot of money for a very important cause this week. love u all a lot.
rp @alfredoflores ily / miss u / this / wish i kept that bra
a public post because i know u creep on your friends on here 
i cant wait to be best friends forever and for all the lifetimes ahead of us  what a blessing it is to have an aaron. 
thank u for making it all make sense. gonna go send u 30 voice notes of me crying reflective, grateful, happy birthday tears. if everyone had a friend like u, the world wouldnt be so trash.

making this project with so many dear friends quite literally saved my life and gave me the courage to be vulnerable and be honest with people. thank u for making me feel heard, safe and incredibly human. it is nice (and so healing) to know that i dont have to hide behind a weird, polished pop star facade and that im able to connect with so many people over my truths and pain. i know that should have clicked for me sooner but it didnt and i want to thank u for showing me first hand that it is okay. all of it. 
i have been writing and creating a lot lately and it feels nice. i am in no rush to pop anything out of the oven yet 
but i do look forward to this new chapter and sharing more stories / life with u. 
sending a tremendous, warm hug.

truly dont know where to start with this one. i tell you this daily but i love you WITH ALL MY HEART. you are the funniest, coolest, hardest working, least sleeping, most CARING human being in the world. when i say i have NO IDEA WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU i ............ cannot stress to you the seriousness or severity of that statement. thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you have done for this tour, for my life and for everyone in it.
the talent  the energy  it has been SUCH an honor and privilege sharing the stage and spending so much time with you this year. thank u for the sharing your brilliant gifts with us all every night, for inspiring me to attempt to sing the way you play, for everything. 
thank you to our incredible stage manager / production manager Ski (who literally is too sweet and pure for this planet ... he always puts his hand over my head to make sure i dont bump it when im running to and from stage / quick change) and to the entire crew that has worked unimaginably hard on this show for ten months... building and breaking down the stage every day and night, lighting us, mixing the sound beautifully, making it possible for us to perform, creating our canvas. quite literally none of this would exist without you and you are so greatly appreciated. 
thank you for making this show possible at all, keeping us safe every night and for always being so kind.

in case u forgot ab this and need to see it again
please forgive all the throwbacks  cant believe its almost been a year
tour is wild. life is wild. im grateful for the sea of love i have around me everyday and for the people who come to these shows and give all of us every ounce of energy theyve got. im grateful to work with the best musicians and dancers in the world. im grateful for my voice and my team. im grateful for this music. im grateful for my tour bus driver, Kurt who bought me pickles yesterday because he saw we ran out. im grateful for the opportunity to sing to thousands of people every night. its a dream come true. no matter how hard it gets or how many feelings come up that are screaming at me to be processed and sorted through one day, im grounded by gratitude and promise not to give up on what ive started. i feel everything very intensely and have committed to doing this tour during a time in my life when im still processing a lot ... so sometimes i cry a lot i thank you for accepting my humanness. im not sure what i did to deserve to meet so many loving souls every night / to feel so much love, but i want you to know that it really does carry me through. i feel it and i appreciate it. and all of you so much. 
im sharing this because im grateful and because i want you to know that if you too are hurting, you can push through and are not alone. it is hard to balance taking care of the people around you, doing your job, and healing / taking care of yourself at the same time... but i want you to know, you arent alone and i think youre doing great. 
first us leg almost over ... five more 
five years of break free 
holy shit. so incredibly grateful  thank you so much listening and for loving something that was quite hard (but also v fun at times ) to make.... thank you for showing me that im not alone in the events that have caused me pain and that its okay to share and open up sometimes. i appreciate you all so much and am endlessly grateful for the consistent love and support youve shown me and this project. i love youuuuuuu. thank you.  
when i tell you ...... there wont be a happier moment than this ever

dear sweetener / thank u next tour audience friends,  were sending out emails soon encouraging you to order a clear bag to bring your things into the venues as security is going to be very precise and smooth but for sure super strict. theyre super cheap and simple but having them ahead of time will for sure help things go as smooth as possible so if you see this in your emails please dont ignore it my team n i appreciate it very much p.s. any clear bags within a certain size (all info will be in the ) are totally fine to bring if you already have your own, i just wanted to make sure you saw these and knew about all this ahead of time so everything can go as smoothly and safely as possible. love you. thank you

happy birthday to a bundle of sparkles and bright, beautiful energy @frankiejgrande 
today filled my heart with so much hope  got to meet many beautiful, passionate people and march alongside my loved ones. the sun came out for us. 
we are so much stronger and louder than hatred, ignorance, sexism, racism, agism, homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, slut shaming, prejudice, discrimination of all kinds, patriarchal conditioning and the backwards expectations of what a woman should be 
I'm so proud of / inspired by everyone who marched today and thankful that there are so many people on this planet currently celebrating how brilliant and magical women truly are 
let's keep our voices loud, passionate & peaceful 
let's continue being strong for each other and to build each other up
let us stay connected to our divinity.

oh douglas middlebrook how i love you so... remember when we were dancing around my kitchen 6 months ago singing Mama I'm a Big Girl now and you convinced me to muster up the courage to call Craig & Neil and ask to audition? Remember how we had never been more excited about anything ever? Remember when we went to the first table read together and died?Remember when we to ran all my lines together on the plane and your Seaweed was the funniest shit I've ever seen? Remember when I literally have been crying since Come So Far ended and you've been making me smile through my post hairspray depression since? This post doesn't even begin to sum up how much fun we've had together throughout this experience because I'm too sad to type but I just love you so much my best friend and I'm so thankful for you. 
never leave me without love 
my LOVE. what's even more special than her God given, breathtaking talent is how she makes people feel  thank you for the millions of hugs and laughs and talks. you are such a gift. i love you so so so so much and it was an honor to sing with you. #ComeSoFar 
I don't know where to start. crying so much today. my heart is with hairspray. my heart is in Baltimore with penny lou pingleton and seaweed and tracy and Mr. & Mrs. Turnblad the motormouth kids and the nicest kids. such a bittersweet feeling.  i can't put into words how grateful i am not only to have played one of my favorite roles in the world, or to have been lucky enough to sing the songs I grew up singing religiously in the car every day on the way to school, but to have been introduced to the most incredibly beautiful people i've ever met. I feel so blessed and so happy and so sad. But mostly, so so grateful. 
Tonight is the night #hairspraylive 8/7c on @NBC  I'm so proud of my friends and of everyone involved in this production and of the message of this show, #Love  We have so so much of it and we can't wait to share it with you tonight.

During this challenging time, we have to remember that the only way we will progress is if the overruling force is #Love. Music is a universal language that all of us can feel regardless of color lines, gender, sexuality, age, race, religion. it unifies us. We believe we can not fight hate with hate, only love. Just as we can not fight darkness with more darkness. Only Light. Too many precious lives were taken from us this week, this month, this year. Rest in peace #AltonSterling. Rest in peace #PhilandoCastile #BlackLivesMatter.
And the police that were peacefully guarding the #BlackLivesMatter rally in Dallas. Rest in peace.
#LorneAhrens, #MichaelKrol, #MichaelJSmith, #BrentThompson & #PatrickZamarripa.
Stay strong and know that better days are coming

I mustache you a question .... #worstcaptionever #icouldntresist #ohwell
thank you @billboard for featuring me & the pups Thank you to @barkbox for allowing me to sponsor so many adoptions over the course of the Honeymoon Tour and for working with me to give my fans the chance to give some of these pups in need their forever homes

 honeymoon kisss  verrrry emotional show, El Paso  I love you (still a couple shows left but this one was very tough..... cried the whole time pretty much lol . thank you El Paso for the extra love and warmth. we're all really startin to feeeeeel it)
 you can assign a different chord to each different posture you make with the gloves as opposed to using a keytar or a midi keyboard. you can do billions of things with the gloves of course but that's what you're seeing in this little clip @imogenheap  @kellysnooksnook #mimugloves
want to thank my idol @imogenheap for allowing me to use the Mimu gloves on my first ever world tour. It's been such an honor and an incredible learning experience to work with you and miss @kellysnooksnook on this 
To show my appreciation and to pay homage I attempted to cover Hide & Seek at my show in El Paso and despite having only an afternoon of rehearsal and only a couple mistakes, it went pretty well (my looper wouldn't cooperate around the "ransom notes" part but of course when I tried it again the next day it worked perfectly ) thank you so much to @kellysnooksnook for joining me on the road and for teaching me your Mimu ways I'll miss scrambling as fast as we can, training postures under the stage before Why Try every night & celebrating right after it's done
thank you again @imogenheap for teaching me, inspiring me endlessly (since forever), for being so generous and kind, and for making me a part of the Mimu family.

feeling mushy. reposting because I'm so proud to be related to this one and he makes me so happy @frankiejgrande. thank you for sharing your message in everything you do... to be unapologetically yourself and to be happy and proud to be who you are to not dim your light for anyone, no matter what they say... and "when someone throws shade, shine brighter" (just the campiest... but so important)... you're the fucking cutest funniest and I love you. I remember when I was growing up I bugged the shit out of you because I was always copying you / always wanted to be right in the middle of you and all your friends.  everything frankie had I had to have next. everything frankie wore I had to wear next (which explains why I still have several pair of heinous 90s Oakley's glasses laying around somewhere)... even today I find myself wanting to be more and more like you your positive energy is so infectious and your sense of humor is ridic.  thanks for being you & for sharing your beautiful self with the world. that is all. love you Fwank.

mom & nonna's commentary is killing me (nonna can't hear a damn thing) #mothersday
w my bbs in the stu (threw it back w that ribbon) (this does not mean in any way shape or form means that ribbons are "back" lol)
happy mothers day mama to the funniest, hardest working, most generous, beautiful, baddest bishhh in the world. thank you for inspiring me endlessly and for being such a wonderful example. you show me how to be kind but not weak, how to be a boss but still a lady, to be sweet but tough as nails, to give and love as generously as possible but to stay protected.  thank you for always putting your family first (although i wish you'd put you first more often), for teaching me to work hard and to stay grounded, for teaching me the thriller choreo when i was 4 years old and for showing me the most selfless, genuine love in the world. i don't think enough people know how fly you are. did y'all know that my mom runs 3 companies that design and manufacture marine communication equipment? the first,
(and probably the only) woman in her industry to ever do that. she's pretty fkkking rad if you ask me. i love you with all my heart and i am so incredibly proud to be your daughter. 
babes, i miss u / love u. been in the studio.
(wish i weren't on tour so i could put it all put rn but i love tour help)
  ( & yes the blondeee pony is back for a lil i missed it )
congrats to my friend @mileycyrus on the launch of @happyhippiefdn you are an  on earth. i can't thank you enough for doing something so important and for having me be part of something so special. thank you for using your voice in such an incredibly positive and heathy way. here's to helping so many sweet babes in need. for more information follow @happyhippiefdn  if you believe in fighting injustice / limiting labeling, assumptions, judgement, challenging stereotypes, encouraging our fellow human beings to feel safe in their skin, and helping homeless youth. this work of yours is so incredibly important i love, appreciate and celebrate you. 
fewww things can make me feel better so instantaneously. nothing like watching @brilovelife and @iamskot infuriate each other. 
happy birthday to two of my fav human beings & fav musicians on earth @victoriamonet @tbhits

here are some dms I sent to a love named maya. posting em on here in hopes that maybe they'll be helpful to some of u loves that can relate I know I can. please be good to u. life is a gift and there is no need to waste it hating on the things we can't control. as hard as that can be. try to focus more on improving the things we actually can control / change.... our outlook, our state of mind, our ego, the way we treat others, the way we treat ourselves, showing more appreciation, not giving into our fears, the way we react to obstacles, etc..  some of the most important work we do during our time here on this earth is the work we do on ourselves. and it's hard work too. love youuuu tons

I start checking the HHN website months ahead of time waiting for them to post what themes they're doing. It's beyond bizarre but I love it so much. This year in La was the scariest by a million miles and I'm already so excited for next year. Massive thanks to Universal for taking care of me & my crew. So happy.

Never has it been so easy to be in love 
And to give you this heart of mine
Want my Instagram friends to see this too. I know it's not an artsy picture or anything but this is something I feel so strongly about. Please think before the next time you call somebody ugly, fat, bitch, faggot, loser, anorexic, freak etc. You don't know how much words can hurt people. We all need to give a little more compassion & kindness.
